## How the app was created?

1. In order to recommend fighters for the fans, it is crucial to gather the most 
information possible about fighters and fights.
2. Since there is no standalone database of all fighters and fights of the UFC, 
I am using data that has been scraped from www.sherdog.com. Thanks to 
geyges who posted that on reddit. 
 + Link post.http://tinyurl.com/zsegztg. The database can also be found at http://www.datasets.co/dataset/All-UFC-Fights thanks to mrborgen86.
3. Here is a sample of part of the fighter table.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

fighters <- read.csv("./data/allFighters.csv", header = TRUE, 
                     na.strings = c(""), colClasses=c("name"="character")) 

sub_fighters <- select(fighters, name, birth_date, height, weight, class, country)
head(sub_fighters, 3)
```

## How the app work?

1. The recommendation is done based on the similarity of fighters.
2. The app creates a list of fighters that has similar patterns of wining 
methods based on a previously selected fighter that you already like.
 + For example, let's say you like **Ronda Rousey**, she is well known for her nasty 
 armbar technique. Since you like Ronda, it is infered that you like __armbar__ 
 techniques. Therefore, a list of fighters that has a high number of fight 
 finishes using armbar is going to be recommended to you. The same idea can be 
 used in the case you like a fighter with a high number of KO's using punches.
